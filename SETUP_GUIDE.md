   Open `package.json` and add this line in the root object:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://damunoz32.github.io/sql-quiz-app"
   ```

3. **Add deploy scripts to package.json:**
   In the "scripts" section, add:
   ```json
   "predeploy": "npm run build",
   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   ```

4. **Build and deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

5. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch
   - Click "Save"

### 5. Update Your Portfolio
