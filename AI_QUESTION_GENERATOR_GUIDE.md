## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aiQuestionGenerator.js    # Core generation logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quizQuestions.js         # Existing questions
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ QuestionGenerator.js     # UI component
â””â”€â”€ App.js                       # Main app integration
```

### Key Functions

#### `generateQuestion(difficulty, category)`
Generates a single question using local templates.

#### `generateQuestions(count, difficulty, categories)`
Generates multiple questions with specified parameters.

#### `generateQuestionWithAI(prompt, apiKey)`
Generates questions using AI API (requires API key).

#### `validateQuestion(question)`
Validates question structure and content.

### Question Structure
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced' | 'expert',
  category: string,
  question: string,
  options: [string, string, string, string],
  correctAnswer: number, // 0-3
  explanation: string,
  sqlExample: string
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Templates

1. **Edit `aiQuestionGenerator.js`**
2. **Add new template to `questionTemplates`**:
```javascript
NEW_CATEGORY: [
  {
    template: "Your question template with {placeholders}",
    actions: ["action1", "action2"],
    options: ["option1", "option2", "option3", "option4"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    category: "NEW_CATEGORY"
  }
]
```

3. **Add to difficulty mappings**:
```javascript
difficultyMappings: {
  beginner: [...existing, 'NEW_CATEGORY'],
  // ... other difficulties
}
```

4. **Add SQL examples and explanations**

### Adding New AI Services

1. **Create new function in `aiQuestionGenerator.js`**:
```javascript
export const generateQuestionWithCustomAI = async (prompt, apiKey) => {
  // Your AI service integration
};
```

2. **Update the QuestionGenerator component** to use your new function

## Best Practices

### Question Generation
